## 🚀 About Me:
💻 I'm a 21-year-old software developer hailing from Mexico, and I'm on a mission to make a mark in the ever-evolving world of technology. With a passion for both web and mobile development, I find myself constantly immersed in the wonderful world of code, always eager to learn and explore.
<br><br>
👨‍💻 Collaboration is my jam, and I thrive when working in a team. There's something magical about the synergy that emerges when creative minds come together to tackle complex challenges. And I'm not one to hoard knowledge—I relish sharing what I've learned with others, fostering an environment of growth and camaraderie.
<br><br>
✨ But here's the secret sauce: while I'm serious about my work, I firmly believe that a bit of humor sprinkled into the mix can go a long way. So, you can count on me for not just lines of code, but also some witty one-liners.
